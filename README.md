An effort to simplify deployments on docker swarm using existing opensource tools.

## Usage

1. Clone this repositiory on your docker swarm manager 
2. Run `./deploy.sh`.

You can add your own stack by creating an appropriately named folder and adding the `docker-compose.yml` file in there. 

You can also remove a stack by hiding it's folder. For example to remove the `whoami` stack, simply execute `mv whoami .whoami`. You could also just delete the folder. Don't forget to execute `./deploy.sh` to apply changes. 

## What's backed in?

### Traefik

Tr√¶fik is a "modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer made to deploy microservices with ease." I like the fact that they have built in integration with letsencrypt, that means free HTTPS. Yes that's right, I bet your bank account will love that.

### Watchtower

Watchtower watches a docker registry and updates your containers when a new image is released

### Portainer

With portainer, you don't have to log into your server just to do `docker exec` on a running container.

### Gitlab

Opensource version control and continous integration software. Also comes with inbuilt docker registry and tons more.
